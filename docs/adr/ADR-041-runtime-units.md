# ADR-041: Runtime Units for Optional Chatto Processes

**Date:** 2026-06-21

## Context

Chatto is growing beyond a single web/API process. Some capabilities should be
able to run as independent processes in production while still being easy for
single-process self-hosters to run from `chatto run`.

Examples include:

- a Prometheus exporter that reads existing NATS resources and does not need
  `ChattoCore`
- a future Bleve search service that replays `EVT`, maintains its own index,
  and answers search requests over NATS
- future media workers for CPU-heavy video transcoding, image processing, and
  derivative generation

These processes need common configuration loading, logging, NATS connection
setup, graceful shutdown, and access to shared Chatto infrastructure. At the
same time, they must not casually call `ChattoCore.Run`, because the main core
boot path legitimately performs boot-time mutations and repair work.

## Decision

Introduce **runtime units** as the convention for optional Chatto processes.

A standalone-capable runtime unit:

- can run standalone as `chatto <unit>`
- can run embedded in `chatto run` when its provider or unit config section has
  `enabled = true`; this selects process composition rather than whether a
  separate consumer-facing feature is exposed
- receives shared config, NATS, JetStream, logger, and version through a small
  runtime environment
- decides explicitly which existing resources or domain services it opens
- does not start embedded NATS when running standalone

A **main-app auxiliary unit** is the documented exception. It owns an
optional listener, worker, or lifecycle under `chatto run`, but it can use the
main app's in-process operation layer. It does not need a standalone command.
This exception is suitable only when a separate process would need a new
private service contract with the main app and would not improve isolation.

Standalone units connect to an existing NATS server as clients. For default
single-process embedded-NATS installs, operators either enable the embedded TCP
listener or set the unit's `enabled = true` flag so `chatto run` starts it in
process using the already-established NATS connection.

Runtime units use a shared explicit registration catalogue for composition and
diagnostics. `chatto run` starts enabled registrations under one coordinated
lifecycle, while a standalone unit command starts the same implementation
regardless of its embedded `enabled` setting. Feature-consumer configuration
stays separate when a replaceable provider is involved. For example,
`search.enabled` exposes message search through the main app, while
`search_provider.enabled` decides whether `chatto run` embeds Chatto's bundled
provider.

`chatto run` supervises enabled optional units independently. A unit that
returns unexpectedly is restarted with exponential backoff capped at 30
seconds, while the main app remains available. Standalone commands instead
return the unit failure to their process supervisor. Units must therefore make
startup and repeated execution safe; durable workers resume through their
application-owned consumer rather than process-local state.

Runtime units are classified by behavior:

- **Observer:** reads existing resources and exposes diagnostics, such as the
  Prometheus exporter. No durable writes.
- **Projection service:** consumes `EVT`, maintains a unit-owned index or read
  model, and exposes a NATS service, such as future search. Usually no durable
  writes.
- **Worker:** performs background work and may append durable facts through the
  owning service or `evtstream.Publisher`, such as future media processing.
- **Main app:** the ConnectRPC/web/realtime-delivery process that owns
  `ChattoCore` boot and HTTP compatibility facades.
- **Main-app auxiliary:** an optional, separately supervised capability that
  uses the main app's operation layer and cannot run standalone. A route on
  the existing public HTTP server is part of the main app, not an auxiliary
  runtime unit.

Durable domain facts still go through `EVT`, and any unit that writes them must
use the same multi-replica-safe OCC and service-boundary rules as the main
process.

## Consequences

Standalone workers and embedded single-process deployments can share one unit
implementation instead of maintaining separate boot paths.

A main-app auxiliary still gets explicit configuration, registration,
supervision, and lifecycle ownership. It does not claim independent deployment
or require a private network API only to satisfy the runtime-unit convention.

An embedded optional capability can recover from missing executables,
projection failures, deleted durable consumers, and other unit-local failures
without forcing the main app to restart. Persistent failures remain visible in
logs at the bounded restart cadence instead of silently leaving the capability
stopped.

The main `chatto run` process remains the only path that starts embedded NATS
and runs the full `ChattoCore` boot sequence. Side units stay explicit about
whether they are read-only projections, request/reply services, or durable
writers.

Future units should reuse the runtime-unit harness before adding new command
setup, signal handling, NATS connection logic, or ad hoc embedded-mode flags.
Workers that need singleton behavior must still coordinate through NATS
primitives such as `MEMORY_CACHE` leases; embedding a unit in `chatto run` is an
operator convenience, not a correctness boundary.

Replaceable provider units communicate with the main app through the same
versioned NATS contract in embedded and standalone topologies. See ADR-053.

## Realized by

The [runtime component inventory](../architecture/runtime-components.md) lists
the concrete units behind this taxonomy: the Runtime-unit catalogue row
(`cli/cmd/run.go`, `cli/internal/runtimeunit/runtimeunit.go`) is the shared
composition and supervision mechanism, `exporter.Unit` is the current Observer,
`bleve.Unit` is the current Projection service, and `video.Unit` is the current
Worker. `ChattoCore` remains the Main app. No Main-app auxiliary unit exists
yet.
