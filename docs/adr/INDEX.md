# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Chatto and
for explicitly repository-wide monorepo or shared-framework decisions. ADRs
document significant architectural decisions along with their context and
consequences.

For more about ADRs, see [Michael Nygard's article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Decisions

Status describes whether a decision still governs the current architecture.
Partially superseded records retain a current foundation while later ADRs
replace part of their original design. Completed records describe a one-time
rollout decision whose implementation and cleanup are finished.
