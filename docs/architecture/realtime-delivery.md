The protobuf realtime API is mounted at `GET /api/realtime` and upgrades to a
binary WebSocket. The first client frame must be `hello`; the server accepts
only protocol version 2 and authenticates either the hello bearer token or an
existing cookie session. The second client frame must be `subscribe_events`.
It may name room timelines already retained with the projection. After
subscription, `hydrate_room` materialises another joined room over the same
ordered stream.

OAuth access-token connections retain their validated client identity after the
hello. Each connection registers a process-local watcher with the durable
OAuth-client projection before continuing. When any replica commits a blocked
or unsupported policy, every replica's projection closes only the watchers for
that client; the handler first cancels authorized work, then best-effort sends
the established terminal `authentication_required` close and tears down the socket.
Registration and the projected-state check are atomic with projection
application, so a block racing connection setup cannot leave an authorized
socket behind. Cookie sessions, first-party bearer sessions, and OAuth sessions
issued to other clients are unaffected.

Human bearer connections also retain the fixed expiry of the access token
accepted during hello. At that instant the handler cancels authorized work,
best-effort sends a reconnecting `authentication_required` close, and tears
down the socket. The bundled frontend serializes refresh for that server,
installs the rotated pair without replacing its per-server state, and reconnects
the same event bus with its RAM-only opaque resume cursor and retained-room set.

Cookie connections retain the cookie record expiry accepted during the HTTP
upgrade. Their timer ends at the start of the final renewal quarter. The
handler cancels authorized work, sends a reconnecting
`session_renewal_required` close when possible, and closes the socket. The
frontend calls the CSRF-protected browser renewal route. That route advances
the same cookie-session record with KV OCC and writes the same SCS handle in a
fresh browser cookie slot with the new lifetime. The frontend then opens the
replacement socket. The upgrade does not update the record or set a cookie.

The frontend keeps its route, projection, opaque cursor, and retained-room set
during this automatic reconnect. The route also returns the next renewal time.
An HTTP timer uses that value when realtime transport is blocked or
disconnected. Bot API keys have no expiry timer.

After the hello, the server revalidates the exact human credential before it
starts the subscription. It repeats that check once per minute. A definitive
revocation closes the socket even if a process-local termination signal was
lost. A temporary storage error leaves the connection open until the next
check.

Bot API-key connections similarly retain only the non-secret HMAC verifier
accepted during the hello. Each connection registers atomically with the
durable user-auth projection. When an individual revocation or a historical
replace-all fact reaches a replica, that projection closes watchers for each
removed verifier.
Connections that use other API keys stay open. The handler cancels authorized
work, sends a terminal `authentication_required` close when possible, and
tears down the selected sockets. The raw API key is not retained in request or
connection context.

The `chatto.realtime.v1` package name is the protobuf namespace, not the
behavioural protocol version. Protocol 2 is the server-scoped projection
stream. It uses `RealtimeProjectionEvent`, an optional resume cursor on
`subscribe_events`, and `caught_up` at the replay-to-live boundary. Application
heartbeats and client `ping`/server `pong` share the same connection.

The bundled client creates its event-bus reducer before discovery completes so
consumers can register synchronously, but it opens the WebSocket only after the
discovered server version satisfies the 0.5 realtime-projection baseline.
Older servers are reported as unsupported rather than receiving the former
ConnectRPC bootstrap plus protocol-v1 live feed. An `unsupported_protocol`
error is terminal for the current bus and does not enter the reconnect loop.

The browser keeps the event bus, projection, readiness phase, and opaque cursor
for every authenticated server in memory for the tab session. Transport is
separate: the URL-active server is `live`, inactive servers are normally
`dormant`, and one inactive server at a time may be `polling`. A poll opens the
same `/api/realtime` stream with that projection's cursor and closes as soon as
`caught_up` arrives. Initial inactive hydration runs immediately; later polls
run about once a minute with jitter and a 30-second client timeout.

Switching servers closes the previous persistent socket without discarding its
state and promotes the selected server to the sole persistent connection.

The application-root `ServerRuntimeCoordinator` owns authenticated-server
transport reconciliation before notification synchronization and routed
content. It remains mounted on public and login routes, seeds the origin viewer
before its first reconciliation, and reacts to restored sessions and late
compatibility discovery. Consequently, a cold welcome-screen load hydrates
inactive registered servers without selecting one or mounting chat-only
presence, profile-cache, prompt, or notice coordination.
Each registration carries its server store's stable projection reducer; the
event-bus manager installs that reducer before opening a transport, so an
initial reset or viewer snapshot cannot arrive before its canonical owner.

The frontend keeps an authenticated server's realtime stream connected
independently of the local presence mode. "Look offline" stops presence
refreshes and lets the live presence record expire; it does not pause event
delivery. Realtime connection establishment itself does not touch presence.

Returning to a tab after at least 30 seconds hidden replaces the active
transport even when the browser still reports its old WebSocket as open. The
replacement supplies the retained projection cursor and room set. Browser
visibility, `pageshow`, online, socket-close, and heartbeat signals do not
start parallel ConnectRPC refreshes for canonical projection data. They only
restore transport liveness; replay or a compacted reset performs convergence.

## Compacted projection prefix

A subscription without a usable cursor emits one ordered stream of
idempotent operations:

- `reset`;
- current public server profile, authenticated server presentation/runtime
  state, and authenticated viewer state;
- every public server directory user;
- lightweight state for every room visible to the viewer and the complete
  visible room-group layout; DM participant references remain eager;
- complete channel membership and the latest 50 renderable timeline events for
  retained DMs. For a retained channel room, it includes all roots with
  `message.read`, or only related roots with `message.read-interactions`;
- the newest finite Notifications 2.0 occurrences, exact total and Important
  unread-occurrence counts, and complete per-room counterparts;
- every active call visible to the viewer; and
- a complete latest-value presence map for the projected user directory.

The snapshot builder uses the same ConnectRPC assemblers as public reads. It
decrypts PII only at the authenticated response boundary and resolves messages
through current deletion and key-shredding projections. Deleted or
crypto-erased bodies therefore appear only as normal tombstones. Requested
timeline windows are assembled concurrently with bounded concurrency.
Never-viewed room bodies are not decrypted during bootstrap.

The projection's room set is exhaustive rather than message-read-filtered. It
includes joined DMs that do not yet contain a message. Each DM summary says
whether it has root-message history. DM membership authorizes the read. The
bundled client retains empty DMs for routing and authorization but omits them
from the sidebar and quick switcher.
The first `room_activity` operation promotes the room into navigation, while an
absent history field from an older server preserves the previous visible
fallback. This lets a `StartDM` response navigate immediately without exposing
an unsolicited empty conversation to another participant.

The frontend applies this prefix and every later event through the same
`ServerProjectionStore` reducer. Server profile, MOTD, and runtime capability
changes replace canonical projection state instead of causing a ConnectRPC
refresh. Canonical timeline pages evict rows beyond their newest 50. Heavier
message stores are created lazily, and selecting a cold room sends
`hydrate_room`. The response atomically replaces its full room membership and
current timeline through the normal projection reducer; it is not a ConnectRPC
bootstrap.

Timeline replacements carry an opaque cursor for every retained row, and later
row upserts carry that row's cursor. The reducer can therefore advance its
pagination boundary using only the projection stream. Each timeline cursor is
encrypted, authenticated, and bound to its viewer plus exact room or
room/thread-root resource, so it cannot be reused as another timeline's
boundary.

On `reset`, the frontend immediately clears content-bearing projection state
and its derived mirrors, including directory profiles, notifications, calls,
preferences, and authenticated runtime settings. It retains the last confirmed
viewer authorization while the replacement prefix hydrates. Mounted admin
queries refetch without discarding their rendered data, so dense tables keep
their geometry. A replacement viewer with a different identity or fewer grants
immediately purges those queries before the management gate removes
inaccessible content.

Changing the route selects retained state immediately after a room's first
hydration. A cold route briefly renders its timeline loading state while the
same WebSocket materialises it. DM labels resolve eager participant references,
while selected channel-member lists resolve hydrated membership through the
already-warm user projection. Server chrome and gutter entries likewise select
projected branding, viewer capabilities, notification preferences, and unread
state instead of independently fetching server/viewer/room snapshots.

The room Files sidebar remains a separate, server-scoped lazy cache rather than
part of the compacted realtime prefix. Each room starts with an empty cache and
performs its attachment-list read only when Files is first opened. Later
attachment-relevant timeline message upserts reconcile attachment rows in
hydrated caches. Updates racing the first read are queued and applied to its
result, while updates racing pagination fence the stale page response.
Projection-only timeline-row removals do not remove the underlying message's
files. Reset and room-access loss clear the cache with the other
content-bearing mirrors; a reset rehydrates it when Files remains visible.

Projection readiness distinguishes cold data from transport freshness. Known
rooms in `ready` or `stale` projections render immediately, including after a
server switch. Absence in a stale projection is not authoritative until the
activation catch-up reaches `caught_up`. Loading placeholders remain for a cold
projection, a room's first timeline hydration, and separately lazy history,
threads, previews, and media.

## Resume and live handoff

The sealed cursor contains an EVT stream incarnation, global sequence, and
viewer binding. XChaCha20-Poly1305 protects it with a purpose-separated key
derived from `core.secret_key`; random nonces prevent equal payloads producing
equal tokens. NATS and JetStream coordinates are never public API facts.

Tampering, cross-user reuse, secret rotation, or foreign stream incarnation
selects a compacted reset. Every cursor also carries a sealed issue time and
expires after 24 hours; expiry selects the same safe reset, limiting captured
cursor reuse while still allowing ordinary reconnect gaps.

The browser retains a cursor only with its corresponding in-memory projection. Socket
reconnects can resume; page reloads and recreated stores omit it and receive a
new compacted prefix. A tab waking after more than 24 hours still presents its
expired cursor, and the server responds with the same compacted reset used for
any other unusable cursor. The client clears and rebuilds the retained
projection through normal operations, then marks it ready only at `caught_up`.

For a valid short gap, the handler subscribes to the process-wide live hub,
captures an EVT cutoff, waits until every registered projection is current
before reading membership, applicable message-read permissions, interaction
relationships, or compacted state, and performs bounded JetStream point reads
for the sequences after the cursor. It
does not create a JetStream consumer. Each
deliverable room, asset, or user fact waits for its owning projection and is
converted to current public resource operations. The handler sends `caught_up`
at the cutoff, discards buffered live duplicates through that sequence, and
continues with the hub stream.

The connection retains only a set of hydrated room IDs. Projection mapping
omits room-timeline assembly for every other room, avoiding message-body
decryption and transfer. Recognized durable facts that have no remaining
operation are still emitted as empty projection envelopes with their sealed
cursor, so one global resume position can advance without making unhydrated
timeline history part of client state. On reconnect the client resends retained
IDs; a compacted reset includes only those room windows.

When Search is enabled, message edits and retractions in an unretained room
reuse the content-free `server_state_upsert` operation as a search refresh fence.
This lets new browsers refetch transient hydrated search plaintext without
materialising room timelines, while older projection-v1 clients safely reapply
the familiar state and advance their cursor.

Effective membership and channel-room message-read permission changes are
authoritative timeline boundaries. DM membership is the complete DM read
boundary. An interaction-scoped timeline contains only related roots, and each
durable message-derived operation is authorized against its canonical thread
root. A direct-mention post waits for the Threads projection before delivery,
so the source operation can establish and use the relationship in order.

Reactions, pins, and asset lifecycle facts also wait for the Threads projection
at their source message. This prevents an authorized event from being omitted
when the relationship projection has processing delay. When a viewer gains
room access through a join, Universal membership, or unarchive, live mapping
pairs the current room and any retained timeline with authoritative active-call
and notification replacements. Newly visible calls therefore appear without a
compacted reset or page reload.

When a Universal room stops granting membership, live mapping pairs its
current room state with an empty replacement for any retained timeline plus
the same viewer-sensitive replacements; loss of room visibility uses
`room_remove`, which has the same eviction effect. The browser scrubs
canonical rows, mounted room stores, open thread stores, optimistic state,
call and notification mirrors, and in-flight reads as soon as projected
membership becomes false. It also disconnects local call media for that room
without issuing a redundant leave command. The privacy fence stays closed.

It opens only after an explicit positive membership operation arrives, so
delayed pagination, previews, read-your-writes responses, and timeline
replacements cannot restore plaintext.

The browser keeps only the non-plaintext retained-room intent. If membership
later returns, the server rematerialises the current window only for that
retained room; never-requested rooms remain lazy. A disconnected client whose
gap contains an authorization-sensitive revocation receives a compacted reset
instead of incremental replay.

The browser advertises a room as retained only after applying its timeline
replacement. Desired rooms with lost or unavailable hydration responses remain
pending and are requested again on the next socket. The browser sends one lazy
hydration at a time; a non-fatal capacity or rate rejection identifies the room
and supplies a retry delay, after which the browser resends it on the same
socket. Both client and server cap retention at 64 room IDs, and the server
ignores duplicate hydration work.

At the bound, the browser evicts its least-recent inactive timeline and replaces
the socket before materialising the newly selected room.

Post-catch-up room hydration shares the process-wide catch-up semaphore and is
serialized per authenticated user across all of that user's sockets. Its token
bucket permits a burst of 20 hydrations and restores one token per second. A
compacted reset emits frames incrementally and materialises at most 64 retained
windows (3,200 recent rows), bounding decryption and transient response memory.

Every subscription emits one finite latest-value reconciliation before
`caught_up`. It replaces the viewer resource; the complete followed-thread
viewer-state set, including RUNTIME_STATE reply-read markers; notification
occurrences and room counts; and the server directory's current presence. Missing
followed-thread entries authoritatively clear follow/unread state on retained
thread roots.

For incremental replay, reconciliation also replaces every visible room's
latest read and permission state because an EVT gap cannot reconstruct
RUNTIME_STATE read markers. A compacted reset instead owns those rows in its
incremental `room_upsert` snapshot frames, so its reconciliation neither
rebuilds nor repeats the complete room viewer-state collection.

The bounded snapshot phase owns server and directory resources, room summaries,
membership, permissions, room read state, room groups, active calls, and
retained timelines.
It also seeds viewer data and notifications.

Reconciliation authoritatively
refreshes viewer data, followed-thread/read state, notifications and counts, and
presence after either replay-plan branch. A reset captures the read-state
index's bounded room-change fence before snapshot assembly and reconciles only
room markers changed after that fence. This delta repairs concurrent or lost
best-effort room-read invalidations with work proportional to concurrent
changes; catch-up retries if the bounded change history is exceeded.

Room Slow Mode configuration is embedded in every projected room. A
`RoomSlowModeChangedEvent` produces an incremental `room_upsert`, immediately
replacing the interval and the viewer's recalculated next-post timestamp.
Every `MessagePostedEvent` already produces a `room_viewer_state_replace`; for
the author this carries the new deadline to all sessions. The same fields are
present in compacted room snapshots and finite reconciliation, so reconnects
do not require a client-side timer record.

Room Threading Mode is likewise embedded in each projected channel. A
`RoomThreadingModeChangedEvent` produces an incremental `room_upsert` and, for
connections retaining that room, a `room_timeline_event_upsert` for the visible
actor-attributed change. Every session therefore changes its composer and
reply actions immediately while the room timeline records why the behavior
changed. Reconnect and finite reconciliation carry the same normalized value;
historical channels whose creation fact omitted it project as Enabled, while
DMs remain Unspecified. An unknown future channel value fails closed to
Disabled on an older binary, while the projection snapshot preserves the raw
value so a rollback does not erase newer semantics.

Buffered live signals cover mutations concurrent with this reconciliation. Thread
follow/unfollow and read-marker advances publish the same user-scoped
viewer-state invalidation; after the finite replacement, a buffered signal is
mapped to the current root timeline row. The complete followed-thread reader
returns an error for uncertain membership, room metadata, follow, or read-marker
state, so catch-up retries rather than converging to a lossy replacement.

Room/thread marker hydration reads the process-wide `ReadStateModel` index,
which is initialized and maintained by one filtered `RUNTIME_STATE` watcher;
realtime subscriptions do not create their own marker watchers.

Notification invalidations carry no transition state. A creation hint can name
one opaque sound candidate. Before it assembles a finite replacement, the
serving replica waits for its `NOTIFICATIONS` projection to become current and
revalidates that candidate. It sends only the authoritative replacement and a
positive `play_notification_sound` instruction when the occurrence is unread,
allowed by current policy and DND state, currently visible, and present in that
same replacement. Notification and Push notification modes permit local sound;
only Push notification creates durable push-delivery work.

A newer read, removal, policy/access change, or lifecycle mutation prevents
sound. The client deduplicates this one-shot effect by the stable enclosing
projection-event ID.

This operation set closes the parts of client state that an EVT gap alone
cannot reconstruct, without a ConnectRPC side read or a second bootstrap
mechanism. Presence and later room/thread read transitions use buffered live
signals on this same stream; durable config changes that affect viewer permissions or
preferences select a compacted reset through their EVT subjects.

Replay scans at most 10,000 EVT sequences and emits at most 2,000 durable
facts. Missing, malformed, expired, foreign-incarnation, oversized, or
authorization-sensitive gaps select the compacted prefix instead of failing
the subscription.

Incremental replay and compacted bootstrap share one process-local catch-up
admission guard. Each replica admits at most eight catch-ups at once and one at
a time per authenticated user. Explicit stale-cursor replay attempts use a
per-user token bucket with a burst of three and one token restored every 20
seconds. Cursorless compacted bootstraps cannot request historical events, and
current-boundary reconnects have no gap, so both use a separate general catch-up
bucket with a burst of 20 and one token restored each second.

If EVT advances between boundary classification and replay planning, the server
charges a replay token before emitting any replay frames, in addition to its
general token. Every admitted catch-up
has a 30-second whole-operation deadline. Capacity rejection sends
`catch_up_in_progress`, `catch_up_rate_limited`, or `catch_up_server_busy` with
reconnect guidance; deadline exhaustion sends `catch_up_timeout`. These limits
bound work and protect availability only. They are deliberately process-local,
and no correctness or authorization decision depends on them.

The metrics endpoint exposes active and total admitted catch-ups, timeouts, and
capacity rejections through `chatto_realtime_catch_ups`,
`chatto_realtime_catch_ups_started_total`,
`chatto_realtime_catch_ups_timed_out_total`, and
`chatto_realtime_catch_ups_rejected_total`.

After catch-up completes and the connection enters steady-state, each authenticated
user is limited to a configurable maximum number of concurrent open realtime
WebSocket connections (default: 30; configurable via
`webserver.realtime_steady_state_connection_cap`, set to 0 to disable). This limit
prevents a single user from exhausting server resources by opening unbounded
connections. Connections exceeding this limit are rejected immediately after
catch-up with a `realtime_capacity_error` close; clients reconnect through normal
backoff. The limit isolates users from each other and applies independently across
replicas. The metrics endpoint exposes rejected steady-state connections through
`chatto_realtime_steady_state_connection_cap_rejected_total`.

Reaction facts produce a timeline-event upsert containing the current
aggregate reaction state and a `reaction_change` describing the exact actor,
emoji, and add/remove transition. Message edits, retractions, and reactions
hydrate the canonical current message row rather than exposing internal EVT.
When a thread reply has a visible channel echo, reaction facts upsert both the
canonical reply and its echo row. A direct retraction that disables only the
echo emits `room_timeline_event_remove`; ordinary deleted messages remain
renderable tombstone upserts.

Pinned-message facts use the existing `server_state_upsert` operation with an
additive `pinned_message_change` containing the action, room ID, and canonical
message event ID. Retractions that remove a projected pin emit the same
idempotent deletion as explicit unpins so clients converge even without
retaining the room timeline. Retained clients refresh the room's canonical pin
page in event order. Older protocol-2 clients ignore the unknown nested field
while continuing to process the known top-level operation.

RBAC facts are fanned through the shared hub. The mapper normally responds with
a reconnecting `projection_reset_required` close so the next subscription
starts from current authorization and removes channel-room message state after
a `message.read` loss. A `message.read` decision does not remove DM state from
a participant. An effective owner's self-authored RBAC mutation cannot change
that owner's authorization. A human viewer's own direct permission mutation
targeting a bot also cannot change that viewer's authorization. In both cases,
the writer's connection receives an empty projection envelope and advances its
cursor without rebuilding the page. Other viewers, including a target bot,
still receive the reset.

## Process-wide live ingress

`MyEventsHub` owns one NATS Core subscription to `live.sync.>` and one to
`live.evt.>` per Chatto process. It classifies subjects before decoding, waits
for projections once, and fans immutable decoded events into count- and
byte-bounded session queues. Sessions for one user share room-visibility state.
There are no per-client NATS or JetStream consumers.

Transient `live.sync.>` payloads use `chatto.core.live.v1.LiveEvent`. Durable
`live.evt.>` payloads use `chatto.core.evt.v1.Event`. The hub maps both internal
packages to the separate public `chatto.realtime.v1` protocol.

A NATS connection continuity gap quarantines the hub and closes every current
session, even when the client reconnects quickly to another cluster member.
The Chatto replica remains unready after transport reconnection until its
JetStream resources are accessible, its volatile `MEMORY_CACHE` bucket has
been recreated when necessary, all registered projections are current, and the
read-state and presence watchers have completed fresh snapshots. The hub then
admits a fresh generation; clients reconnect with their retained cursor and
recover through normal replay or compacted reset.

Directory metadata facts for visible nonmember rooms are additionally fanned
to sessions. The hub maintains a per-user cache of
currently authorized directory rooms: facts for a room never seen by that user
are suppressed, while loss of visibility emits removal only when the room was
previously visible.
Directory visibility reads use bounded concurrency outside the hub mutex and
hydrate only room existence, archive state, and visibility permissions.
Administrative membership facts replace the complete current member-reference
list for existing viewers.

Message and asset facts are delivered only when the viewer is a member. A
channel-room viewer also needs broad `message.read`, or
`message.read-interactions` with a relationship to the canonical thread root.
DM membership authorizes DM delivery. The hub and public projection mapper
both check this boundary.

Archived rooms are removed from the fast-path realtime membership cache when a
`RoomArchived` event commits, ensuring that non-message metadata events
(call start/end, member changes, and administrative facts) cannot leak to
remaining members after archival. Membership filtering applies before metadata
delivery, so archived rooms cannot deliver updates through either the compacted
replay or incremental live path.

Message facts do not carry room summaries or room viewer state. Root messages
carry a content-free `room_activity` operation for room order and first-message
visibility. Notification counts converge through notification signals and the
finite resume replacement. Message delivery does not reassemble or retransmit
room permissions or complete channel membership. Echo tombstone upserts
distinguish canonical-reply deletion from direct echo removal.

Typing is transient rather than durable, but it follows the same read boundary.
The hub and public projection mapper suppress typing events unless the viewer
is a member. Main-room typing needs broad `message.read`. Thread typing also
permits `message.read-interactions` with a relationship to that thread.

Room-read signals emit a focused room viewer activity replacement and a finite
notification replacement. The focused operation contains only unread and Slow
Mode state. It does not contain membership or permission decisions.
Root-message activity operations advance the affected room even when its
timeline is not retained. A later viewer activity replacement therefore cannot
undo DM sorting.

A durable projection hydration or mapping failure closes the session
without advancing its cursor. Reconnect retries that EVT sequence or selects a
compacted reset, so a later cursor cannot make a dropped mutation permanent.
Historical message creation for an echo that is hidden in current projection
state maps to an idempotent timeline removal. Asset processing and deletion
facts map to authoritative upserts of their owning message and any visible
channel echo, so replay never advances beyond a durable attachment mutation
without applying its current render state.

The browser applies the same fail-closed rule. An undecodable frame or unknown
projection operation closes the socket, leaves the preceding cursor intact,
and retries from that position. A projection event is validated in full before
either reducer mutates state, preventing partial application of an atomic
event. A completed inactive poll becomes `stale` as soon as its socket closes:
known resources remain renderable, but absence is not authoritative while the
transport is dormant.

Mounted room stores may retain deliberately paginated history. Thread stores
are reference-counted by mounted thread panes and disposed after their final
consumer unmounts, so inactive threads receive no later fanout and are not
reloaded during reset.

Typing, presence transitions, and session termination continue as
`RealtimeEventEnvelope` frames on the same WebSocket. Mention and new-DM
attention do not use separate transient hint frames. Notification occurrence
create, update, and delete signals assemble an authoritative
`notification_occurrences_replace` that contains occurrences plus exact total
and Important counts. Human connections and bot API-key connections receive
this same viewer-scoped replacement. The browser can decorate followed-thread
rows directly from matching unread occurrences in this replacement.
A live replacement can carry transition metadata for one-shot presentation
effects, while replay and finite reconciliation omit it.

The internal signal carries no stream coordinate. Before emitting the
replacement at that live cursor, the serving replica waits until the
notification projection is current, preventing a cross-replica invalidation
from advancing the cursor with stale state. Replacements contain at most 50 exact occurrences plus
complete aggregate totals and the next list expiry boundary. Clients refresh
at that boundary and use the separately paginated ConnectRPC read for older
occurrences. They also quietly reconcile the first page once per minute, which
bounds count staleness if a best-effort Core NATS invalidation is lost while a
tab remains connected.

Badge marker changes use a separate content-free user invalidation. The server
maps a new or previously inactive marker to an authoritative room viewer
activity replacement. A later source can advance the same active Badge marker
without another public invalidation because the visible unread value did not
change. The public thread projection reports follow and reply-unread state
only. The Message Read Cursor determines `has_unread_replies`. Clients do not
receive either internal storage coordinate. A thread Badge rolls up into the
parent room, and notification orange takes visual priority over the neutral
room dot.

A reply post, edit, or retraction also emits a
`thread_viewer_states_replace` for a viewer who follows the affected thread.
This operation lets a mounted My Threads view refresh its query-backed message
summary when the source room timeline is not retained.

Viewer preferences, thread follow/read state, profile changes, server layout,
and member removal likewise mutate the client only through projection
operations. Active calls converge through `active_calls_replace` in the
compacted prefix, after every durable call transition, and when room access
changes the set visible to the viewer. Call-started and call-ended facts pair
that replacement with a timeline-event upsert for clients retaining the room,
so the call state and lifecycle row advance under one projection cursor.

Transient frames have no durable cursor. Finite notification-list and
presence state are reconciled explicitly on every subscription. The
process-wide PresenceHub retains current presence and fans out later
transitions.

A `user_remove` operation purges copied profile fields from room membership,
timeline includes, notification actors, active-call participants, retained
message/thread render stores, and the shared profile cache. Historical rows may
retain the stable user ID, but not a renderable user object.

Process-wide ingress loss or projection-readiness failure quarantines the hub
and closes every session. A slow session that exceeds its queue limits is
closed independently. Both cases reconnect through resume or a compacted reset
rather than continuing a healthy-looking stream across an unobservable gap.

WebSocket connections use small read/write buffers and share a write-buffer
pool. When compression is enabled, the server uses Huffman-only DEFLATE and
compresses frames of at least 1 KiB.

| Endpoint        | Frame schema                                          | Authorization                                                                                                               | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/realtime` | `chatto.realtime.v1.Realtime*` binary protobuf frames | Bearer token in hello or cookie auth; current per-resource and room visibility is applied before public projection mapping. | Protocol 2 server-scoped compacted/resumable projection delivery. |

The realtime client projection does not supersede `chatto.api.v1`. Public
ConnectRPC resources remain the integrations surface for explicit reads,
pagination, mutations, and read-your-writes responses; realtime protocol 2 is
an optional ordered convergence feed for clients maintaining local state.
