# Runtime Component Inventory

The core runtime is process-local but must be safe under multiple Chatto replicas connected to the same NATS account. Correctness comes from JetStream/KV atomicity and projection catch-up, not in-process serialization.

`chatto run` composes optional runtime units from a validated catalogue. A
registration supplies a `runtimeunit.Unit` plus a config predicate that
controls whether it starts in the main process. Standalone-capable units also
use the same implementation in a standalone command. The exporter, bundled
search provider, and asset-processing worker are registered units. An embedded
unit failure is logged and degrades that optional capability without stopping
the core server. The catalogue supervisor restarts it with exponential backoff
capped at 30 seconds. A standalone-capable unit failure still exits for its
process supervisor.
Independently deployable providers use this catalogue rather than adding
custom startup blocks.

## Client runtimes

The experimental Electron desktop shell is a Chatto client runtime using a
pinned stable Electron and bundled Chromium release. It embeds the official
static SvelteKit build and intercepts the fixed secure origin
`chatto://desktop` without opening a TCP listener; ordinary HTTP and HTTPS
traffic remains on Chromium's normal network path. The existing standalone
frontend owns server registration, authentication, and routing.

Electron's default persistent session stores browser state in the application's
user-data directory. Browser and desktop deployments use the same popup-based
OAuth flow and return the same-origin callback through `BroadcastChannel`.
The shared frontend then persists the renewable bearer pair and expiry metadata
per server, serializes background refresh with same-tab coalescing and a
same-browser Web Lock, and updates its existing API and realtime transports in
place. Permanent refresh failure preserves the current route and requires an
explicit reconnect; it never opens OAuth automatically.

The shell owns no Chatto backend, NATS resources, projections, or durable
domain state. Every macOS build adds a narrow optional `screenShare` renderer
capability and a nested ScreenCaptureKit helper. The bridge lists bounded,
temporary opaque window/display sources with static JPEG previews and controls
a publish-only native LiveKit companion. Preview bytes cross Electron as
structured-clone data and remain in memory; captured media stays in the
helper's native WebRTC path, so only credentials and acknowledged lifecycle
control cross IPC during publication.

Window capture includes isolated owning-application audio. Display capture is
video-only because system audio
would include remote call playback. The companion publishes an H.264 simulcast
ladder and enables dynacast so LiveKit can select receiver-appropriate
qualities and pause unused layers.

The shared frontend feature-detects the capability through its focused desktop
adapter. One screen-share control opens Chatto's source chooser when the
capability exists and otherwise invokes the complete browser/LiveKit path,
including the browser's own chooser. This is the host-capability pattern from
[ADR-072](../adr/ADR-072-optional-host-capabilities-in-the-shared-frontend.md);
the frontend does not branch on Electron, macOS, the app origin, or user-agent
identity.

macOS CI builds and smoke-tests the helper inside the complete app
bundle. The shell restricts navigation and browser
permissions at the Electron boundary, while OAuth behavior remains specified by
[FDR-023](../fdr/FDR-023-authentication-and-sessions.md).

The core model inventory is a list of stable machine-readable keys such as `config_model`, `message_model`, and `my_events_model`. Per-process metrics expose these keys via `chatto_model_info`.
