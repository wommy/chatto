# FDR-014: Jump to Present

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-03

## Overview

When a user is reading older messages in a room — either because they scrolled up or because they navigated to a historical message — a "Jump to Present" button appears, letting them return to the latest messages with one click. The button also surfaces context: it shows the date of the first visible message, and switches its label to "New messages" when new ones arrive while the user is scrolled away.

## Behavior

- The button appears in two situations:
  1. **Scrolled up from the bottom** — the user manually scrolled away from the latest messages in a room that has enough history to overflow the viewport.
  2. **Jumped mode** — the user clicked a reply-attribution link, a search result, or a notification, and the room loaded a window of messages around that historical target.
- In either case, clicking the button returns the user to the latest messages.
- The button shows the date of the first visible message ("Yesterday | Jump to Present", "March 12 | Jump to Present").
- When new messages arrive while the user is scrolled up, the button label switches from "Jump to Present" to "New messages".
- The button auto-dismisses when the user scrolls back within 10px of the bottom. Jumped mode uses a separate, larger 50px threshold when it settles right after landing on the jump target, so a jump that lands close to the present does not show the button at all. In jumped mode, the button also dismisses if the user has scrolled all the way to the bottom and all newer messages have loaded.
- The button fades in and out smoothly to avoid flicker.

## Design Decisions

### 1. One button, two triggers

**Decision:** The "scrolled away" case and the "jumped mode" case share the same button UI and date display.
**Why:** Behaviorally they're the same affordance — "I'm not looking at the latest, get me there". Two separate buttons would mean redundant UI and divergent logic for the same user need.
**Tradeoff:** The click handler has to branch internally on which mode is active (scroll-to-bottom vs reload-latest). Acceptable; the modes are easy to distinguish.

### 2. Date display alongside the action

**Decision:** The button shows the date of the first visible message inline with the "Jump to Present" label.
**Why:** When users are scrolled deep in history, the date is the most useful piece of context — "where am I in time, and how far is it to the present?". Adding it to the button keeps that context one glance away.
**Tradeoff:** The button is wider than a pure-action button would be. Worth it; the date is a low-clutter element with high informational value.

### 3. "New messages" label when scrolled-away gets new traffic

**Decision:** When new messages arrive while the user is scrolled up, the button's label switches from "Jump to Present" to "New messages".
**Why:** It's a stronger affordance than the badge-and-counter pattern: the same button the user was going to click anyway now carries an urgency signal. Reduces UI surface.
**Tradeoff:** Users who don't realize "New messages" is the same button as "Jump to Present" might be briefly confused. The button position and date display stay constant, which mitigates this.

### 4. Jumped-mode exit reloads from the server

**Decision:** Clicking the button in jumped mode doesn't scroll — it reloads the latest page of messages from the server.
**Why:** In jumped mode the loaded message window is a slice around the target message, with no guarantee that it extends to "now". Scrolling to the bottom of the loaded window would land somewhere arbitrary; the user actually wants to leave jumped mode entirely.
**Tradeoff:** The click triggers a network request. In practice the latest page is usually small and the round-trip is fast.

### 5. Scroll-up lock against virtua corrections

**Decision:** A short (~150ms) lock prevents the message list's internal scroll-jump corrections from immediately re-enabling auto-scroll after a user scroll-up is detected.
**Why:** Without it, the virtualized list's adjustments after a measurement update could be interpreted as the user scrolling down, immediately dismissing the button after the user just scrolled up. The lock filters out those self-induced movements.
**Tradeoff:** Real user scroll-down within the lock window is briefly ignored. The window is short enough that this is imperceptible.
