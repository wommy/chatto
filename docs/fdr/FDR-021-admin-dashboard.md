# FDR-021: Admin Dashboard & System Monitoring

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-03

## Overview

The server-management section gives owners and admins visibility into the server's operational state: user counts, room counts, storage resource usage, projection health, and audit/event-log diagnostics. It lives within a broader management area that also gives delegated managers direct access to the rooms and room groups they are authorised to configure. Operational views deliberately expose metadata — never message content, never per-user activity logs, never per-room conversation summaries.

## Behavior

- Management UI lives under `/chat/[serverId]/manage/`. Server-wide pages live below `/manage/server/`; individual room and room-group settings use sibling resource routes.
- Legacy `/chat/[serverId]/server-admin/...` deep links permanently redirect to their equivalent management routes so bookmarks and shared links continue to work.
- Every member can open Settings from the primary server navigation. The server sidebar then shows a unified Settings sidebar with three collapsible groups: App preferences, Your account, and Server configuration. It also shows a Back to Server action. App preferences apply to all servers. Your account and Server configuration apply to the server named in the Settings header. Server configuration contains only the destinations that the viewer can use. Settings opens the first permitted server-wide destination. If there is no permitted destination, Settings opens the member's Profile.
- Delegated managers enter a specific room or room group through its contextual settings action. Resource pages use effective scoped permissions and do not imply access to unrelated server-management pages.
- **Users page** — paginated list of all server members with user, login, joined date, and roles. Verified email addresses appear on the per-user detail page. Admins can edit profiles, assign roles, suspend, or delete users when they hold the relevant permission.
- **System Info page** — owner-only page showing backing message-broker connection status, storage account limits and current usage, stream/consumer health, known durable-worker queue health, projection health (lag, entry counts, and rough memory estimates), asset-cleanup health (health state, pending count, and whether the deletion-event scan is caught up), and `AdminDiagnosticsService.GetSystemInfo` stats (user count, channel room count, DM room count).
- **Audit log page** — chronological diagnostic event-log view for forensic review, grouped by event creation date. The list view uses `AdminEventLogService.ListEvents`; the detail view uses `AdminEventLogService.GetEvent` to show sanitized payload JSON for human inspection. Password verifiers are omitted.
- The audit log UI can be filtered by exact event type and exact actor ID. Event type suggestions come from the admin event-log API; the actor field reuses the server member lookup but still accepts synthetic actor IDs such as `system:bootstrap`. The API also supports inclusive created-at bounds for callers, but the server-management page does not expose time-range controls.
- The audit/event-log API returns `totalCount` as a 64-bit value because it reflects retained stream message counts, which can exceed 32-bit integer range on long-running servers.
- Filtered audit-log browsing is a bounded diagnostic scan over retained EVT rows, not an indexed analytics query. The connection reports `scannedCount`, `scanLimit`, and `scanLimited` so the UI can tell operators when older matches may exist beyond the inspected window.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Capability-based Server Configuration navigation

**Decision:** There is no separate `admin.access` permission. Settings is available to every member because it contains App preferences and the member's account settings. The Server configuration group is a capability index. It shows only destinations that have a concrete capability. Child routes and API methods apply their narrower gates, such as `server.manage`, `admin.view-users`, `admin.view-audit`, `role.manage`, and owner-only diagnostics.
**Why:** All members need a stable location for app-wide and server-scoped choices. Some operators need a read-only admin role. Other operators need access to users but not to system information. One permission-filtered Settings surface supports these roles without a parallel role system.
**Tradeoff:** There is no separate permission to see the admin dashboard. The Settings entry is always visible. The UI must clearly separate app-wide choices, personal server choices, and permission-gated Server configuration.

### 2. Operational metadata, not conversation content

**Decision:** The System Info page can expose operational metadata such as stream/consumer state and projection diagnostics, but not message bodies, file contents, per-user activity trails, or per-room conversation summaries.
**Why:** Operators need enough detail to diagnose lag, storage pressure, and projection growth. Those are system-health questions, not moderation questions. Keeping content and behavioral surveillance out of the admin dashboard preserves the privacy boundary while still making the server operable.
**Tradeoff:** Some identifiers and subject filters are visible to admins with system access. That is acceptable for the operator persona, but any future content-level moderation surface should be a separate, explicit feature.

### 3. Privacy boundary: admins see metadata, not content

**Decision:** Admins can see who exists, what rooms exist, who's a member, who has which roles. They cannot see message content, private messages, file contents, or user passwords.
**Why:** "Operate the system" and "read user conversations" are different jobs. Conflating them would mean every operator needs the trust level of a moderator with access to every conversation. Keeping the boundary explicit lets owners hire operators without granting message visibility.
**Tradeoff:** Moderation tools that need to read content (rare cases) would need a separate, auditable feature with explicit consent. None exists today.

### 4. Live data, not cached

**Decision:** System Info fetches fresh data from NATS and projection diagnostics on every page load. No caching layer.
**Why:** The data is fundamentally point-in-time ("how much storage are we using right now?"). Caching would mean stale numbers shown to operators making capacity decisions. The fetch cost is low because NATS already has the data internally.
**Tradeoff:** Refreshing the page hits NATS every time. Not a concern at admin-usage volume.

### 5. Diagnostic values are operator tooling, not product contracts

**Decision:** Raw storage subjects, stream/consumer names, sanitized payload JSON, projection metric names, and memory estimates are documented as diagnostic values. The admin diagnostics APIs are intentional operator APIs, but clients should not parse those values as stable product-domain data. Payload JSON omits password verifiers.
**Why:** Operators need visibility into what the runtime is doing. At the same time, these values reflect storage and projection implementation details that may evolve as the event-sourcing model settles.
**Tradeoff:** Third-party admin clients can display diagnostics but should treat raw strings and JSON as best-effort inspection data. If a future integration needs a stable audit export format, it should get a dedicated schema instead of depending on diagnostic payloads.

Known durable workers use stable diagnostic keys and stream-scoped,
broker-derived state. A waiting pull demonstrates availability; unacknowledged
work with an available worker is working. Ack-pending work without a waiting
pull is explicitly unconfirmed because broker state cannot distinguish a busy
handler from a crashed handler awaiting redelivery. A declared consumer with
neither is stalled. Currently unacknowledged redeliveries remain informational
and do not by themselves make current health look failed. Core-owned consumers are
required; asset processing is inactive whenever video uploads are disabled,
even if its durable consumer remains retained.

### 6. Event-log filters are bounded diagnostic scans

**Decision:** `AdminEventLogService.ListEvents` supports exact event-type and actor-ID matching plus inclusive created-at bounds, but filtered reads scan at most 5,000 retained EVT rows per request. The server-management UI currently exposes event-type and actor filters and groups the newest-first table by creation date.
**Why:** EVT is the source of truth, not an indexed analytics store. The filters make the admin page useful for common investigations without adding a second durable index or allowing one request to walk an unbounded stream.
**Tradeoff:** A sparse filter on a large server may report `scanLimited: true` before finding every historical match. Operators can narrow the time range or inspect older windows explicitly; a future export/analytics feature should get a dedicated read model.

### 7. Admin APIs use service-level grouping with field-specific capability gates

**Decision:** Admin operations are grouped under dedicated ConnectRPC services, while sensitive methods check their own capabilities (`server.manage`, `admin.view-users`, `admin.view-audit`, `role.manage`, scoped `room.manage`, owner-only diagnostics) before returning data.
**Why:** Dedicated service grouping gives the API obvious admin-tooling namespaces, and method-level checks let operators delegate user, system, audit, and RBAC-editor visibility independently.
**Tradeoff:** A user may be able to enter the admin area but see permission denials or empty panels for specific sections. The UI has to reflect that capability split clearly.

### 8. One management namespace, scoped by resource

**Decision:** Server, room, and room-group configuration share the `/manage` namespace. Server-only operations live under `/manage/server`, while rooms and room groups are addressed as resources alongside it.
**Why:** Room and room-group permissions can be delegated without granting server-wide administration. A resource-oriented management area gives those managers a direct destination without creating a separate top-level settings section for every manageable resource.
**Tradeoff:** The unified Settings shell cannot assume that each viewer has the same Server configuration navigation. It must get navigation and access from the selected resource and the viewer's effective capabilities. It must also keep App preferences and account settings available.

## Permissions

- `admin.view-users` — gates user-management views, admin-only affordances, and user-sensitive fields such as other users' verified email addresses and login cooldowns. The underlying `server.members` directory query remains authenticated-user visible; see FDR-025.
- System diagnostics are owner-only; `admin.view-system` is exposed only as a viewer capability key, not as a grantable RBAC permission.
- `admin.view-audit` — gates admin event log, event type, and event detail reads.
- `role.manage` — configures roles and role permission decisions, including scoped room and room-group matrices without granting general room-management authority.
- `role.assign` — gates user role assignment and revocation; non-owner assignments remain bounded by the actor's own scoped authority.
- `room.manage` — gates general room and room-group settings at the effective resource scope; server-scope grants also gate global room-group creation and ordering.
- `user.manage-accounts` — gates user creation, cross-user identity edits, password resets, verified-email attachment, and login-cooldown resets.

## Open Questions

- A more sensitive operator-only surface for raw storage inspection or content moderation would need its own permission and audit model. Not currently planned.
