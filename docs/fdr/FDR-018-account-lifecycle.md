# FDR-018: Account Lifecycle

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-03

## Overview

This FDR covers human accounts from registration through deletion: signup, email verification, self-service account deletion, and the crypto-shredding model that makes deletion permanent and reliable. The same deletion and crypto-shredding mechanics also apply when a bot is deleted through its management API, as specified by FDR-038. Authentication mechanics (login, sessions, tokens) live in FDR-023.

## Behavior

### Registration

- A human user starts registration with an email address. Chatto returns the same generic response whether the address is available or already claimed, so the registration endpoint does not disclose existing accounts.
- Chatto sends a six-digit verification code to an available address. Verifying the code returns a short-lived completion token; it does not create an account.
- The user then chooses a login and password. The login must pass uniqueness, format, and blocked-username checks, and the email is checked again in case it was claimed while the completion token was outstanding.
- Successful completion creates the account with the email already verified. There is no partially registered or unverified account state in the direct-registration flow.
- Registration and verification codes are backed by `RUNTIME_STATE` HMAC-derived records with configurable per-key TTLs (default 15 minutes). Raw code values are never written to `EVT` or backup archives. If email delivery fails, the pending OTP is cancelled so the failed send does not consume resend throttle capacity.
- If the verified email matches an entry in `owners.emails` in the server config, the new user is auto-assigned the `owner` role when the verified email is attached.

### Email management

- A human user can have multiple verified email addresses on file. Bot accounts cannot have verified emails.
- Adding a new email triggers a verification mail to the new address; the email is added in pending state until the code is confirmed.
- A user can delete one of their verified emails as long as at least one verified email remains.
- Email verification code issuance is recorded in the EVT audit log with a hashed email, expiry, and safe request metadata; the raw code is not recorded.

### Account deletion

- A human user requests their own deletion via Account Settings.
- Self-service deletion requires `user.delete-self` when the user requests a
  confirmation token and when they use it. If an operator revokes the
  permission, the user cannot use a token that was created before revocation.
- An administrator with `admin.view-users` and `user.delete-any` can delete
  another human member from the member detail page in Server Administration.
  The entry point links to a full-page confirmation that states what deletion
  does. The administrator must type the member's login. Chatto does not request
  the administrator's password or require a fresh credential for this action.
  The admin page does not offer this action for the administrator's own account
  or for a bot. Self-deletion stays in Account Settings, and bots follow
  FDR-038.
- A two-step confirmation flow asks the user to type a confirmation string before the deletion executes.
- Account deletion confirmation-token issuance is recorded in the EVT audit log with expiry and safe request metadata; the raw token is not recorded.
- The account deletion confirmation token itself lives in `RUNTIME_STATE` under an HMAC-derived key with a 15-minute per-key TTL.
- On deletion, the server: records `UserKeyShreddingRequestedEvent` with the complete opaque key coordinates, immediately tombstones the user's profile, authentication, search, and authored message state, then idempotently shreds app-owned DEK refs from `RUNTIME_STATE` and KMS wrapping-key refs from `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`. `UserKeyShreddedEvent` records physical completion. Durable workers retry unfinished key shredding and current message-owned asset deletion facts across crashes and replicas.
- After deletion, all messages the user ever posted are tombstoned by projection before decryption and cryptographically unreadable. Timeline clients apply the normal deleted-message retention rule, so placeholders without current attachments, previews, reactions, or thread replies disappear immediately.
- Deleting an account removes its notification list, notification read and
  visibility boundaries, and push subscriptions. Push-credential cleanup
  retries from the durable account-deletion fact across crashes and partial
  failures. Occurrences caused by the deleted account retain no copied profile
  PII; current actor hydration may disappear without exposing the deleted
  identity.
- Historical room join and leave facts remain stored, but timeline messages omit deleted users from membership activity. Grouped activity includes only visible actors, and the row is hidden when none remain.
- New durable user events store login, display name, and verified email as encrypted PII payloads. Projections retain those encrypted envelopes, decrypt login/email transiently to derive in-memory lookup digests and decrypt fields for reads, and remove user-owned lookup entries when the account is crypto-shredded.
- The login is freed up for re-use.
- Bots cannot request their own deletion. Their owner or a human user with `bot.manage` deletes them through `BotService`; deleting a human owner also deletes every bot they own. Those paths use the same durable deletion and crypto-shredding behavior described above.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Verify email before creating a direct-registration account

**Decision:** Direct registration proves control of the email address before asking for the login and password that complete account creation. The verification code yields a short-lived completion token; only successful completion creates the account and attaches the already-verified email.
**Why:** This avoids durable half-created accounts, prevents unverified users from occupying login names, and ensures every directly registered account begins with a usable recovery address. Generic code-request responses avoid turning the flow into an account-enumeration endpoint.
**Tradeoff:** Direct registration requires working email delivery before the user can choose credentials or enter the application. A lost or expired code restarts the verification step instead of leaving an account that can be resumed.

### 2. Multiple verified emails per user

**Decision:** A user can attach multiple verified email addresses. Any of them count for owner-email matching, password resets, and identity correlation.
**Why:** People have work and personal addresses, change jobs, or have an alias. Single-email accounts force needless friction during transitions. Multiple-emails also helps the `owners.emails` config — operators can list either an old or new email and the right user gets owner status.
**Tradeoff:** The data model and resolvers have to handle a list, not a scalar. Minor extra complexity in exchange for real flexibility.

### 2a. Workflow tokens in runtime state

**Decision:** Registration and email-verification codes, registration completion tokens, password-reset tokens, and account-deletion confirmation tokens are stored in `RUNTIME_STATE` under HMAC-derived keys with per-key TTLs. The HMAC input is scoped by workflow and keyed by `[core].secret_key`.
**Why:** These values are raw credentials or credential-adjacent workflow state. They need restart and restore survival, but they are not reconstructable account history and should not become event-log or backup secrets. The audit value is captured separately in safe EVT facts.
**Tradeoff:** Operators must keep `[core].secret_key` stable across restores if pending account workflows should continue working. Changing it intentionally invalidates outstanding registration, email-verification, password-reset, and account-deletion credentials.

### 3. Deliberate deletion confirmation

**Decision:** Self-service deletion requires the user to type a confirmation phrase, not only click a button. Administrator deletion requires the administrator to type the target member's exact login. The `RequestAccountDeletion` RPC sets up the self-service flow, and `DeleteMyAccount` completes it.
**Why:** Deletion is irreversible because the encryption key is destroyed and messages cannot be recovered. The typed value reduces accidental deletion and makes the administrator confirm the correct target. It is a user-interface safety measure, not authentication proof or protection against script execution in the trusted origin.
**Tradeoff:** The additional step makes deletion slower. This is acceptable for an irreversible action.

### 4. Crypto-shredding instead of message deletion

**Decision:** Account deletion first appends `UserKeyShreddingRequestedEvent` at the exact user-aggregate tail; a concurrent key mutation conflicts and retries the request. Account deletion aborts if the request cannot be made durable. Projections treat that request as the immediate fail-closed privacy boundary. The request path and a shared durable worker reconstruct affected key refs from the user's immutable DEK-generation facts and surviving runtime DEK records, shred every wrapping key before deleting any DEK record, and then record physical completion with `UserKeyShreddedEvent`. Message-owned assets, including derivative children such as thumbnails and video variants, receive `AssetDeletedEvent` and have their backing bytes removed.
**Why:** Scanning every JetStream stream and KV bucket for a user's messages would be slow, error-prone, and leave fragments in backups and replicas. Recording deletion intent before irreversible work removes the crash window where keys could be gone without a tombstone fact. The user aggregate already provides a narrow durable index of the affected DEKs, and KEK-first deletion keeps current wrapping refs rediscoverable across retries without duplicating storage coordinates in the request event. Backups specifically exclude the encryption key bucket so that restoring a backup doesn't restore the ability to read deleted users' messages. See ADR-007.
**Tradeoff:** Encrypted-but-unreadable message bytes linger forever. Storage cost is small for text; binary assets are explicitly deleted because signed URLs could otherwise keep serving blobs until expiry. A deployment must upgrade all request-serving replicas before using the new deletion protocol and cannot safely roll back once request facts exist.

### 5. Per-user KEKs, not shared keys

**Decision:** Each user has their own KEK, addressed through an opaque KMS key ref. New messages use a purpose-scoped message-body DEK epoch stored under an opaque app-owned content-key ref and wrapped by that key ref; durable user PII uses a separate user-PII DEK epoch. Legacy messages encrypted directly with the per-user key remain readable.
**Why:** Shared keys would mean one user's deletion can't crypto-shred their messages without affecting others. Per-user KEKs make each deletion fully self-contained, while opaque key refs, content-key refs, and purpose-scoped DEK epochs keep message and user events compact and map cleanly to local DEK storage plus external KMS unwrap flows. See ADR-007.
**Tradeoff:** Message-body and user-PII decryption have to resolve and unwrap the relevant DEK epoch. The built-in KMS path is cheap and local today; an external KMS may need caching policy and latency budgets.

### 6. Durable user PII is encrypted, not indexed in EVT

**Decision:** New durable user events encrypt login, display name, and verified email fields with the user's active user-PII DEK epoch. User and mentionable projections decrypt login/email transiently while applying events to derive normalised in-memory lookup digests, then discard the plaintext. They retain ciphertext for read hydration; no lookup digest is persisted in EVT.
**Why:** Immutable event logs are the wrong long-term home for plaintext PII. Keeping the encrypted payload in EVT preserves replayability without a separate PII KV store, and deletion destroys the key needed to rebuild the data. See ADR-007.
**Tradeoff:** Projection replay and reads need access to key-unwrapping and may incur KMS latency, mitigated by request-scoped DEK reuse during reads. If a user's key is gone, cold replay intentionally cannot rebuild their PII or uniqueness indexes.

### 7. KMS service boundary, even though it's in-process

**Decision:** KEK creation, DEK wrapping/unwrapping, and KEK shredding go through a KMS service interface (`CreateKey`, `WrapContentKey`, `UnwrapContentKey`, `ShredKey`) using opaque key refs rather than direct KEK access or user IDs. DEK record create/load/shred stays in application-owned `RUNTIME_STATE` storage.
**Why:** A clean KMS boundary is what makes future extraction to Vault / AWS KMS / HSM possible without turning the external KMS into Chatto's DEK registry. Keeping wrapped DEKs in `RUNTIME_STATE` also preserves them in normal data backups without backing up the KEKs needed to unwrap them. See ADR-007.
**Tradeoff:** A tiny indirection layer for what's currently an in-process call. Legacy direct-key body decrypt still has a local raw-KEK compatibility path until old bodies age out.

### 8. Login is freed on deletion

**Decision:** After account deletion, the deleted user's login is available for re-use by a new signup.
**Why:** Holding usernames forever would gradually exhaust the namespace. Re-use is acceptable because the new owner gets a new identity (new user ID, new encryption key) — they don't inherit any of the previous user's data or messages.
**Tradeoff:** Old @mentions of the previous user may visually point at the new user once the login is reclaimed. The underlying mention link is to the user *id*, which is gone; the rendering falls back to plain text.

## Permissions

- Self: an authenticated human user can update their own profile (FDR-022), add or remove their own emails, and delete their own account.
- `user.delete-any` — admin permission to delete other users' accounts.
- `user.delete-self` — gates a human user's own-account deletion. Granted to `everyone` by default; operators can revoke it to lock down self-deletion. Bots cannot exercise it even if an allow appears in their direct permission matrix.

## Open Questions

- Should "delete" be replaceable with "anonymize" (keep messages, scrub identity)? Today the choice is delete-and-shred or nothing. Operators occasionally want a middle ground for moderation purposes.
