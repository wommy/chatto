# Chatto Docker Compose Example

This example deploys a clustered Chatto setup with:

- **NATS** - Message broker with JetStream persistence
- **LiveKit** - WebRTC media server for voice and video calls
- **Chatto** - App server connecting to external NATS
- **Caddy** - Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS and load balancing

## Quick Start

Point `chat.example.com` and `livekit.chat.example.com` at your server, open the
ports listed below, then run:

```bash
./init-env.sh chat.example.com admin@example.com
# Replace the CHATTO_SMTP_* placeholders in .env, then:
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `https://chat.example.com` and register with `admin@example.com`. Caddy
obtains the HTTPS certificates automatically. The rest of this README explains
the stack and the available customization options.

All services use the `unless-stopped` restart policy, so Docker restarts them
after a failure or host reboot unless you stopped them manually.

`livekit.chat.example.com` is only an example. You can use any hostname you
control, such as `calls.example.com`; update `CHATTO_LIVEKIT_URL` and the
matching proxy route when using a different name.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (v2) installed
- A domain pointing to your server (for automatic HTTPS)
- A `livekit.` subdomain pointing to the same server (e.g., `livekit.chat.example.com`)
- Firewall allowing inbound TCP 80, 443, and 7881 plus UDP 3478 and 7882
- DNS resolution and outbound UDP from LiveKit for STUN-based public-IP
  discovery

## Why This Example Runs NATS Separately

Chatto can embed NATS in its own process, which is ideal for the smallest binary
setup. This Compose example runs NATS JetStream separately so you can restart or
replace Chatto without restarting its data store, scale Chatto to multiple
replicas, and move to a NATS cluster later.

You are not locked into either model. Chatto's backup command creates a portable
JetStream archive that can be restored into embedded or external NATS, making it
straightforward to move between binary, Compose, and clustered deployments. See
the [Backup & Restore guide](https://docs.chatto.run/guides/operations/backup-restore/) for
the migration workflow and encryption-key guidance.

## Using Your Existing Reverse Proxy

The included Caddy service is a convenient default, not a requirement. If you
already run Caddy, nginx, Apache, Traefik, or another public web server, keep it
and configure two routes:

| Public endpoint | Destination | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your Chatto HTTPS hostname | `chatto:4000` | Chatto web app, ConnectRPC APIs, realtime connections, and the LiveKit webhook |
| Your LiveKit secure WebSocket hostname | `livekit:7880` | LiveKit API and WebSocket signaling |

The hostnames can be any names you control. Both need publicly trusted TLS
certificates. If your proxy is on the Compose network, use the service names
above. If it runs on the Docker host, publish both upstreams on loopback:

```yaml
services:
  chatto:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4000:4000"
  livekit:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:7880:7880"
```

Then remove the `caddy` service and its volumes from `compose.yml`. Keep the
LiveKit media `ports` mappings described below.

## What the Included Caddy Does

When you do not already have a proxy, the included Caddy service obtains the
certificates, configures both HTTP routes, and load-balances Chatto replicas.
It does not carry WebRTC media. The standard Caddy image is an HTTP server and
does not include the optional Caddy L4 plugin.

Preserve these public ports when using Caddy or your own proxy:

| Public endpoint | Destination | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your Chatto and LiveKit hostnames (TCP 443) | Your HTTP proxy | HTTPS and secure WebSocket traffic |
| TCP 7881 | `livekit:7881` | WebRTC media fallback when direct UDP is unavailable |
| UDP 3478 | `livekit:3478` | LiveKit's embedded TURN/STUN relay |
| UDP 7882 | `livekit:7882` | Direct WebRTC media |

With `rtc.use_external_ip: true`, the LiveKit server sends STUN requests at
startup to discover the public address it should advertise. Allow DNS and
outbound UDP from the LiveKit container to LiveKit's default STUN services.
These are server-side requests; browsers use the embedded TURN/STUN service
advertised by this deployment.

The example already enables LiveKit's built-in TURN/UDP server for browsers; no
separate TURN service is required for the common case. If public STUN is not
acceptable for server-side IP discovery, point `rtc.stun_servers` at a
self-hosted [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) instance or another STUN
service you operate. If the host has a stable public IP, you can instead set
`rtc.use_external_ip: false` and `rtc.node_ip` to that address, which avoids
STUN-based discovery. A private LAN deployment can set only
`rtc.use_external_ip: false` and let LiveKit advertise its local address.

TCP 80 is also published in this example so Caddy can redirect HTTP and solve
the ACME HTTP challenge. Your replacement proxy may use a different certificate
flow. TLS for both HTTPS endpoints must use a publicly trusted certificate.

The Compose `ports` entries publish LiveKit media directly on the host, so no L4
Caddy configuration is needed. Do not expose NATS port 4222 publicly; Chatto and
NATS communicate only over the private Compose network.

## Configuration

1. Generate `.env` and the LiveKit config:

   ```bash
   ./init-env.sh chat.example.com admin@example.com
   ```

   Replace `chat.example.com` with your Chatto domain and `admin@example.com`
   with the email address you will use for the first account.

   The script is the recommended setup path. It writes `.env`, `nats.conf`, and
   `livekit.generated.yaml`, generates strong secrets, and keeps the shared
   values aligned:

   - NATS auth token in `nats.conf` and `CHATTO_NATS_CLIENT_TOKEN` in `.env`
   - Chatto cookie, core, and asset signing secrets
   - `CHATTO_LIVEKIT_API_KEY` / `CHATTO_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
   - The matching LiveKit `keys:` and webhook URL

2. Edit `.env` and review the generated values.

   In most cases, you should only need to change:

   - `PUBLIC_URL` - Your domain (e.g., `chat.example.com`)
   - `CHATTO_OWNERS_EMAILS` - Comma-separated verified email addresses that should become Chatto owners. Include the email address you will use for the first account.
   - `CHATTO_SMTP_*` - Default transactional email transport for direct email/password registration, email verification, and password reset. Use `CHATTO_EMAIL_*` instead when configuring JMAP.
   - `PUID` and `PGID` - Optional host user/group IDs for files Chatto writes to mounted volumes. Defaults to `1000:1000`.
   - `CHATTO_OPERATOR_API_*` - Enables the private in-container operator socket used by `chatto operator ...`.

   Leave `LIVEKIT_CONFIG_FILE=./livekit.generated.yaml` unless you deliberately
   want to maintain `livekit.yaml` by hand.

3. Configure transactional email settings if you use direct email/password registration. SMTP is the default; JMAP is an alternative.

### Prefer to configure it by hand?

You usually do not need to. If you manage secrets elsewhere, start with:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the placeholders and make sure the LiveKit key and secret are the same
in `.env` and `livekit.yaml`. LiveKit requires its API secret to be at least 32
characters.

## Usage

```bash
# Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View logs for a specific service
docker compose logs -f chatto

# Restart a service
docker compose restart chatto

# Stop the stack
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (deletes all data)
docker compose down -v
```

## Scaling

```bash
# Scale to 5 replicas
docker compose up -d --scale chatto=5
```

Caddy discovers the replicas through Docker's internal DNS and distributes new
requests across them. Existing realtime connections remain on the replica that
accepted them.

## Verify the Deployment

```bash
# Validate and render the Compose configuration
docker compose config

# Confirm all containers are running
docker compose ps

# Check both HTTPS endpoints
curl --fail --silent --show-error --output /dev/null https://chat.example.com
curl --fail --silent --show-error --output /dev/null https://livekit.chat.example.com
```

The HTTPS checks verify routing and LiveKit signaling, but not WebRTC media.
Join a call from two different networks or devices to exercise TCP 7881 and the
UDP media ports 3478 and 7882.

## Inspecting NATS

The Chatto image includes the `nats` CLI and writes a context for the runtime
NATS connection. Run it as the `chatto` user so the CLI reads the context from
`/home/chatto`:

```bash
docker compose exec -u chatto chatto nats stream ls
```

## Operator Commands

The generated `.env` enables the local operator API socket inside the Chatto
container. Run operator commands as the `chatto` user and use `list --search`
to find a stable user ID before mutating an account:

```bash
docker compose exec -u chatto chatto /chatto operator user list
docker compose exec -u chatto chatto /chatto operator user list --search admin@example.com
docker compose exec -u chatto chatto /chatto operator user set-password USER_ID
```

Do not mount or publish the operator socket unless the target container or host
is fully trusted; socket access is root-equivalent Chatto authority.

## Updating

```bash
# Pull new images and recreate containers
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Volumes

Data is persisted in Docker volumes:

- `nats_data` - NATS/JetStream data (messages, KV stores)
- `caddy_data` - TLS certificates
- `caddy_config` - Caddy configuration cache

## Disabling Voice and Video Calls

If you don't need calls, remove the `livekit` service from `compose.yml`, delete the selected LiveKit config (`livekit.generated.yaml` or `livekit.yaml`), remove the `livekit.*` block from the `Caddyfile`, and remove the LiveKit environment variables from `.env`. You can then close TCP 7881 and UDP 3478 and 7882 and remove the `livekit.*` DNS record.

## Troubleshooting

**Chatto can't connect to NATS**: Ensure the token in `nats.conf` matches `CHATTO_NATS_CLIENT_TOKEN` in `.env`. If you ran `init-env.sh`, they are automatically aligned. If you created files by hand, verify they use the same token value.

**Registration says email delivery is not configured**: Configure the SMTP `CHATTO_SMTP_*` settings or set `CHATTO_EMAIL_TRANSPORT=jmap` with the required `CHATTO_EMAIL_JMAP_*` values in `.env`. Direct email/password registration sends a code by email.

**The first account is not an owner**: Ensure `CHATTO_OWNERS_EMAILS` contains that account's verified email address. Chatto assigns matching owner roles when the email is verified and on server boot.

**Caddy not getting certificates**: Ensure your domain's DNS points to your server and ports 80/443 are open.

**Calls not working**: Ensure the LiveKit API key/secret in `.env` matches the `keys:` section in the selected LiveKit config (`livekit.generated.yaml` or `livekit.yaml`). Also verify the webhook URL points to your Chatto instance. Make sure `CHATTO_LIVEKIT_URL` uses the public `wss://livekit.` subdomain (not the internal Docker hostname), since browsers connect to it directly.

**LiveKit media ports**: The example exposes UDP 7882 for direct WebRTC media, UDP 3478 for LiveKit's embedded TURN/STUN relay, and TCP 7881 as a media fallback. Ensure your firewall allows all three.

**LiveKit fails to start with `could not resolve external IP`**: With
`rtc.use_external_ip: true`, allow DNS and outbound UDP to every endpoint in
`rtc.stun_servers`. Alternatively, configure private STUN servers or disable
external-IP discovery and set `rtc.node_ip` to the host's stable public IP.

**Calls fail for some users**: The built-in TURN/UDP relay helps with symmetric NATs and some mobile, Firefox, and restrictive-network cases. Networks that block UDP entirely still need TURN/TLS. Run coturn on a dedicated host or configure LiveKit's built-in TURN/TLS listener with a matching domain and certificate.
