# Chatto Checkup

The standard documentation rounds. The checkup is **propose-only**: it audits and reports, never auto-applies fixes.

Heavier or more opinionated work — dependency upgrades, security review — is deliberately **not** invoked here. The end-of-report section points the human at those skills so they can decide whether to run them.

## What It Runs

Run these in parallel via the Skill tool:

- **`/fdr`** (no args) — audit all FDRs against the codebase. Surface discrepancies, stale design decisions, and any user-facing features that should now have an FDR.
- **`/adr-review`** — audit ADRs for staleness. Surface cited file paths or APIs that no longer exist; flag superseded ADRs still referenced as authoritative.
- **`/chatto-architecture-inventory`** — audit `docs/architecture/` against the current state of runtime components, projections and snapshots, EVT event tokens, EVT/live subject patterns, NATS resources and runtime-state keys, durable effects, mounted interface boundaries, and realtime delivery. Report drift; propose updates.

## How To Run

1. Invoke all three audits in parallel.
2. **Compile a single consolidated report** at the end. Don't dump three separate report bodies on the user.
3. Present the consolidated report with three sections:
   - **FDR drift** — FDRs that no longer match the code; candidate features for new FDRs.
   - **ADR drift** — stale references in older ADRs.
   - **Architecture drift** — stale facts in `docs/architecture/`, grouped by inventory category.
4. End with a **Recommended next step** — usually one action with the biggest payoff (e.g., "land the FDR-016 update first; the rest can wait").
5. Then a final **Other skills you may want to run** section that lists, as plain pointers (no invocation):
   - `/update-project-dependencies` — bump deps within semver and run tests
   - `/chatto-security-review` — multi-agent security audit
6. **Wait for user direction** before applying anything. The checkup never auto-applies.

## Report Format

Output a single Markdown report. Brief findings, no walls of text. For every finding, include:

- **What** — one sentence
- **Where** — file path, stream name, or FDR/ADR number
- **Suggested action** — one line

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't apply changes without asking.** The checkup is a status report, not a refactor session.
- **Don't repeat raw audit output verbatim.** Compile and summarize. The point of the meta-skill is to compress three reports into one.
- **Don't invoke `/update-project-dependencies` or `/chatto-security-review`.** They're surfaced as pointers at the end of the report; the human invokes them.
- **Don't open follow-up PRs from inside the checkup.** Hand the findings back; let the user decide what to act on.
