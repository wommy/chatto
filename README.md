# Chatto

A really good chat application for teams and communities, free and easy to self-host, with [cloud hosting available soon](https://chatto.run/cloud).

This repository temporarily incubates the early
[Authling](authling/README.md) identity-provider module. Authling is developed
and released independently from Chatto and is intended to move to its own
repository once it no longer needs frequent atomic changes with the shared
[event-sourcing framework](pkg/events/README.md),
[embedded NATS runtime](pkg/natsruntime/README.md),
[data-cryptography primitives](pkg/datacrypto/README.md), and
[application-configuration loader](pkg/appconfig/README.md).

## Local Development Stack

Run the local Chatto backend and Vite frontend, Authling, Mailpit, and LiveKit:

```sh
mise trust
mise install
mise setup
(cd authling && mise trust && mise install && mise deps)
mise dev
```

`mise dev` runs the services in one supervised process group. Vite reloads
frontend changes. Restart it after you change Chatto or Authling Go code.
`mise setup` builds the shared API types and Lingua packages.

[Portless](https://portless.sh/) provides HTTPS routes for browser-facing
services. In Conductor, replace `<workspace>` with the workspace name:

- Chatto: `https://chatto.<workspace>.localhost:42444`
- Authling: `https://authling.<workspace>.localhost:42444`
- Mailpit: `https://mailpit.<workspace>.localhost:42444`
- LiveKit: `https://livekit.<workspace>.localhost:42444`

Outside Conductor, Portless uses the `local` route suffix. Services listen on
loopback ports from base port `4000` (or `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` in Conductor).

Create an Authling account, read its verification code in Mailpit, then choose
**Authling** on the Chatto login screen. Chatto asks for a username at first
login. The stack also creates Chatto owner `alice` and member `bob`; both use
the development-only password `foobar123`.

Chatto uses Authling as its development OIDC provider. Chatto data is in
`cli/data/`; Authling identity data is in
`.context/dev-portless/<workspace>/nested/authling/`.

These credentials and accounts are for local development only. Stop `mise dev`
to stop the services and unregister the routes. With the stack stopped, remove
either data directory to reset that service. A new Conductor workspace name
also creates a new Authling issuer and state directory.

Portless creates and trusts a development CA on its first run. If macOS cannot
show its authorization prompt, run this command once in an interactive terminal:

```sh
mise x node@24 npm:portless@0.15.5 -- portless trust
```
